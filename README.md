# Project Name 
medical_insurance_portfolio.md

## Description

For this project, I will be investigating a medical insurance costs dataset in a .csv file of 1339 American subjects. 
 
Will Explore areas where the data may include bias and how that would impact potential use cases.
In this code, we analyze the 'smoker' era, and will investigate if and how this status affects the other variables. 

It is implemented in Python and is part of my portfolio.

## Conclusions

### countplot norm of the frequency of who gets insurance grouped by smokers:

- To conclude, the only correlation between variables in this df is the status of smoker and the amount they are charged of.
- The number of subjects who do not smoke is 790 higher than those who smoke and receive insurance, i.e. 60% more,
which is interesting because non-smokers pay less 23615.97 mean. 
- We can understand that those who
smoke will suffer more desires.
